The origin of making this was the fact that San Francisco has traditionally very old doorbell buzzer systems. If you're not home, often packages are left at the door to be stolen.

Features:
- Sending a push message when someone buzzes.
- Allowing you to buzz your door to let that person in.

Main Components:
1. ESP32
2. Relay Module
3. Optocoupler
4. Buck Converter Board
