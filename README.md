The problem to solve was that my building has traditionally very old doorbell buzzer systems and porch pirates looking for packages to steal. I needed a way to let me know someone was at the door, and let them in even if I wasn't home.

Features:
- Sending a push message when someone buzzes.
- Allowing you to buzz your door to let that person in.

Main Components:
1. ESP32 Module
2. Custom PCB with Buck Converter & Relay
4. Blynk Integration for Push Messages / App to trigger the relay
