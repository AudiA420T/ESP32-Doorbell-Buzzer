The problem to solve was that San Francisco has traditionally very old doorbell buzzer systems and porch pirates looking for packages to steal. I needed a way to let me know someone was at the door, and let them in even if I wasn't home.

Features:
- Sending a push message when someone buzzes.
- Allowing you to buzz your door to let that person in.

Main Components:
1. ESP32
2. Relay Module
3. Optocoupler
4. Buck Converter Board
